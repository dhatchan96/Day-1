/* 1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
=> In a nutshell, the shift from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 brings crucial improvements to web communication:

        Multiplexing: HTTP/2 enables concurrent data transfer, reducing latency by allowing multiple requests to be processed simultaneously over a single connection.

        Header Compression: Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses compressed headers, minimizing data transfer overhead and accelerating load times.

        Binary Protocol: HTTP/2 adopts a binary format for more efficient parsing, reducing errors during transmission and enhancing data compression.

        Server Push: This feature allows servers to proactively send resources to clients, optimizing load times by anticipating and fulfilling potential requests.

        Prioritization: HTTP/2 introduces advanced prioritization, enabling clients to specify the importance of resources for faster and more efficient processing.

        The transition to HTTP/2 signifies a quantum leap in web performance, offering a more streamlined, faster, and efficient browsing experience. */


/* 2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


=> JavaScript objects, fundamental to the language's versatility, hold key-value pairs and are structured internally by property descriptors and a prototype chain. Understanding these internals is vital for effective manipulation.

Property Descriptors: Define attributes like writability and enumerability.
Prototype Chain: Enables inheritance for cleaner, reusable code.
Creating objects varies:

Object Literal: Simple and quick.
Constructor Functions: Structured blueprints.
Object.create(): Prototype-based object creation.
JavaScript's prototypal inheritance enhances flexibility. Armed with this knowledge, developers unlock the potential to create efficient, modular, and scalable JavaScript applications. */
