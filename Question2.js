/*  2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


=>  Introduction:
    JavaScript objects are like treasure chests holding valuable information. Let's take a peek inside without diving too deep into technical jargon. In this blog, we'll explore how objects work in plain and simple terms.

    Objects in JavaScript:
    Think of objects as containers. You have a box, and inside it, you put things with labels. In JavaScript, an object is created with curly braces {}. Here's a quick example:
    
    For example :
    let person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 25,
    profession: "Developer"
    };
    person is our box, and inside, we've labeled three things: name, age, and profession.

    What's Inside the Box - Properties:
    Properties are like the labeled things inside our box. They can be names, ages, or professions. Each property can hold a specific piece of information.

    For example :
    console.log(person.name); // Outputs: John Doe
    This is how we retrieve something from our box.

    Changing Stuff Inside the Box:
    Now, what if we want to change or add something? JavaScript makes it easy:

    For example :
    person.age = 26; // We just updated the age!
    person.city = "Techland"; // We added a new thing!
    We simply assign a new value or add a new label, and our box is updated.

    Conclusion:
    JavaScript objects are like everyday containers that make organizing information a breeze. You have a box, put labeled things inside, and can easily change or add more stuff. Understanding this simple concept helps you wield the power of objects in your web development journey. So, go ahead, create your boxes, label your things, and let the simplicity of JavaScript objects enhance your coding adventures! */
